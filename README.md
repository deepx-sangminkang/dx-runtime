# DEEPX DX-Runtime

## DXNN® - DEEPX NPU SDK (DX-AS: DEEPX All-Suite)

**DX-AS (DEEPX All-Suite)** is an integrated environment of frameworks and tools that enables inference and compilation of AI models using DEEPX devices. Users can build the integrated environment by installing individual tools, but DX-AS maintains optimal compatibility by aligning the versions of the individual tools.

## Create User Manual

### Install Python Dependencies

To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-video pymdown-extensions mkdocs-with-pdf 
```

### Generate Documentation (HTML and PDF)

To generate the user guide as both HTML and PDF files, execute the following command:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This will create:
- **HTML documentation** in the `docs/` folder - open `docs/index.html` in your web browser
- **PDF file**: `DEEPX_[sub-module]_UM_[version]_[release_date].pdf` in the root directory
