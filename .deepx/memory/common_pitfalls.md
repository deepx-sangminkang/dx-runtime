# Common Pitfalls

Read this file at every task start. Each entry is tagged with a domain and follows the Symptom / Root Cause / Fix structure.

**Domain tags:** `[UNIVERSAL]` (applies everywhere), `[DX_APP]` (standalone inference), `[DX_STREAM]` (GStreamer pipelines), `[PPU]` (pre/post-processing unit models), `[INTEGRATION]` (cross-project issues).

## [UNIVERSAL] model_registry.json Model Name Case Mismatch

- **Symptom**: `KeyError` or `ModelNotFoundError` when loading a model by name. The .dxnn file exists on disk but the registry lookup fails silently.
- **Root Cause**: Model names in `model_registry.json` are case-sensitive. Entries like `"YOLOv8s"` will not match a query for `"yolov8s"` or `"Yolov8s"`. The registry performs exact string matching with no normalization.
- **Fix**: Always use the exact case from `model_registry.json`. Run `grep -i <model_name> model_registry.json` to find the canonical name. When writing config files, copy-paste the model name rather than typing it manually.

---

## [DX_STREAM] DxPreprocess preprocess-id / DxInfer preprocess-id Mismatch

- **Symptom**: Pipeline runs but inference results are garbage — bounding boxes in wrong locations, classifications always wrong, or segmentation masks are shifted.
- **Root Cause**: `DxPreprocess` and `DxInfer` elements are linked by a `preprocess-id` property. If the IDs do not match, `DxInfer` receives unprocessed or incorrectly-processed frames. The pipeline does not raise an error because the buffer dimensions may still be valid.
- **Fix**: Ensure every `DxPreprocess` / `DxInfer` pair shares the same `preprocess-id` value. In multi-model pipelines, use distinct IDs per model stage (e.g., `preprocess-id=0` for detection, `preprocess-id=1` for classification).

```
DxPreprocess preprocess-id=0 ! ... ! DxInfer preprocess-id=0 model=detect.dxnn
DxPreprocess preprocess-id=1 ! ... ! DxInfer preprocess-id=1 model=classify.dxnn
```

---

## [DX_APP] AsyncRunner Frame Order Inversion

- **Symptom**: Displayed detections lag behind the video by 1-2 frames, or bounding boxes appear on the wrong frame. Most visible when objects move quickly.
- **Root Cause**: `AsyncRunner` uses a 3-stage pipeline (frame N-1 postprocess, frame N inference, frame N+1 preprocess). If the callback consumes results without matching them to the correct frame index, results are drawn on the wrong frame.
- **Fix**: Use the `frame_id` field returned in the `AsyncRunner` result callback. Match `result.frame_id` to the display buffer's frame index. Never assume results arrive in submission order when `num_workers > 1`.

```python
runner = AsyncRunner(engine, num_workers=2)
for frame in source:
    runner.submit(frame, frame_id=frame.index)
    results = runner.get_ready()
    for r in results:
        display_buffer[r.frame_id].draw(r.detections)
```

## [DX_APP] dx_postprocess Not Installed — C++ Postprocessor ImportError

- **Symptom**: `ImportError: No module named 'dx_postprocess'` or `cannot find libdx_postprocess.so` when running an app that uses the C++ postprocessor variant.
- **Root Cause**: The `dx_postprocess` package is a compiled C++ extension that ships separately from the Python SDK. It is not installed by `pip install deepx-runtime`. The Python-only fallback postprocessor works but is 5-10x slower.
- **Fix**: Install the native postprocessor package: `sudo apt install dx-postprocess` or build from source with `cmake .. && make install` in the `dx_postprocess/` directory. Verify: `python -c "import dx_postprocess"`.

---

## [DX_STREAM] RTSP Stream Buffer Overload Without DxRate

- **Symptom**: Memory usage grows steadily over minutes. Pipeline eventually crashes with `GStreamer: out of memory` or frames visibly freeze while buffers accumulate.
- **Root Cause**: RTSP sources push frames at the camera's native rate (e.g., 30 FPS) regardless of downstream processing speed. Without rate limiting, queues between elements overflow. The NPU inference stage is the usual bottleneck.
- **Fix**: Insert a `DxRate` element immediately after the RTSP source to drop excess frames before they enter the processing pipeline:

```
rtspsrc location=rtsp://... ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! DxRate rate=15 ! DxPreprocess ...
```

Set `rate` to the target inference FPS (not the camera FPS).

---

## [PPU] PPU Models Require Dedicated Postprocessors

- **Symptom**: Standard YOLO postprocessor returns zero detections or crashes with shape mismatch when used with PPU model variants (e.g., `YoloV5S_PPU.dxnn`).
- **Root Cause**: PPU (Pre/Post-Processing Unit) models offload NMS and output formatting to dedicated hardware. Their output tensor layout differs from standard models — they emit final detection tuples directly rather than raw feature maps.
- **Fix**: Use the PPU-specific postprocessor: `PPUPostprocessor` instead of `YoloPostprocessor`. In config, set `"postprocessor": "ppu_nms"`. The PPU output format is `[batch, max_detections, 7]` where columns are `[batch_id, x1, y1, x2, y2, score, class_id]`.

---

## [DX_APP] OBB Detection Uses score_threshold Only (No NMS)

- **Symptom**: OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) detections show excessive overlapping boxes, and adjusting `nms_threshold` has no visible effect.
- **Root Cause**: OBB models (e.g., `yolo26n-obb`) use rotated bounding boxes that are not compatible with standard axis-aligned NMS. The postprocessor filters by `score_threshold` only. The `nms_threshold` parameter is accepted but ignored.
- **Fix**: Use a stricter `score_threshold` (e.g., 0.5 instead of 0.25) to control detection density. For custom overlap filtering, implement rotated IoU in post-processing:

```python
config = {"score_threshold": 0.5}  # nms_threshold has no effect for OBB
```

---

## [DX_STREAM] DxMsgBroker Must Follow DxMsgConv

- **Symptom**: `DxMsgBroker` element fails to start or sends empty messages. Pipeline logs show `No metadata found on buffer` warnings.
- **Root Cause**: `DxMsgBroker` (MQTT/Kafka publisher) expects serialized message metadata on incoming buffers. `DxMsgConv` converts inference results into the wire format. Without `DxMsgConv`, `DxMsgBroker` receives raw video buffers with no message payload.
- **Fix**: Always place `DxMsgConv` before `DxMsgBroker` in the pipeline:

```
... ! DxInfer model=detect.dxnn ! DxMsgConv ! DxMsgBroker topic=detections conn-str=mqtt://broker:1883
```

---

## [UNIVERSAL] Headless Mode — Check DISPLAY/WAYLAND_DISPLAY Before OpenCV imshow

- **Symptom**: `cv2.error: (-2:Unspecified error) The function is not implemented` or `cannot open display` crash on headless servers, Docker containers, or SSH sessions.
- **Root Cause**: `cv2.imshow()` requires a display server (X11 or Wayland). Headless environments have neither `DISPLAY` nor `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set.
- **Fix**: Check for display availability before enabling visualization:

```python
import os
HAS_DISPLAY = bool(os.environ.get("DISPLAY") or os.environ.get("WAYLAND_DISPLAY"))

if HAS_DISPLAY:
    cv2.imshow("output", frame)
else:
    # Write to file or stream via RTSP
    cv2.imwrite(f"output_{frame_id:06d}.jpg", frame)
```

Use `--no-display` flag in CLI apps built with `parse_common_args()`.

---

## [UNIVERSAL] DX-RT Version < 3.0.0 Causes Silent Inference Failures

- **Symptom**: Inference returns all-zero tensors or nonsensical values. No error messages in logs. Model loads successfully but produces no valid detections.
- **Root Cause**: DX-RT versions prior to 3.0.0 have a tensor memory alignment bug that corrupts output buffers on certain .dxnn model architectures. The bug is data-dependent and does not trigger error codes.
- **Fix**: Upgrade DX-RT to >= 3.0.0: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install dx-runtime>=3.0.0`. Verify version: `dxrt-cli --version`. If upgrading is not possible, force explicit output buffer allocation with `InferenceEngine.set_output_buffer(np.zeros(...))`.

---

## [DX_APP] config.json score_threshold Alias Confusion

- **Symptom**: Setting `score_threshold` in config.json has no effect. Detections still appear at very low confidence.
- **Root Cause**: Some older model configs and community examples use `conf_threshold` instead of `score_threshold`. The postprocessor silently ignores unrecognized keys and falls back to the default (typically 0.25).
- **Fix**: Check the model's reference config to determine the correct key name. Current standard is `score_threshold`. If inheriting from an older config, rename the field:

```json
{
    "score_threshold": 0.5,
    "nms_threshold": 0.45
}
```

Avoid using both keys simultaneously — the postprocessor uses whichever it recognizes and ignores the other.

---

## [DX_STREAM] Cascaded (Secondary Mode) Pipeline — Correct Pattern

- **Symptom**: Agent generates a cascaded pipeline using a non-existent `DxRoiExtract` element. Pipeline fails to launch or element registration check fails.
- **Root Cause**: `DxRoiExtract` does not exist in dx_stream. ROI extraction for secondary inference is handled automatically by `DxPreprocess` when `secondary-mode=true` is set.
- **Fix**: Use `secondary-mode=true` on the secondary `DxPreprocess`, `DxInfer`, and `DxPostprocess` elements with `tee`+`DxGather` for branching. Reference: `pipelines/secondary_mode/run_secondary_mode.sh`.

```
source ! DxPreprocess preprocess-id=0 ! DxInfer preprocess-id=0 ! DxPostprocess ! DxTracker !
tee name=t
  t. ! queue ! DxPreprocess secondary-mode=true preprocess-id=1 ! queue !
         DxInfer secondary-mode=true preprocess-id=1 ! queue !
         DxPostprocess secondary-mode=true ! queue ! gather.sink_0
DxGather name=gather ! DxOsd ! sink
```

## [INTEGRATION] model_registry.json and model_list.json Model Name Mismatch

- **Symptom**: A model works correctly in dx_app standalone tests but fails to load in dx_stream pipeline, or vice versa. Error messages reference different model names or file paths.
- **Root Cause**: dx_app uses `config/model_registry.json` and dx_stream uses `model_list.json` at the repository root. These two registries are maintained independently. If a model is added to one but not the other, or if the model name differs (e.g., `"yolov8n"` vs `"YOLOv8n-Detection"`), cross-project workflows break.
- **Fix**: When adding a new model, always update BOTH registries simultaneously. Use the exact same model name in both files. Run the unified validator to catch mismatches:

```bash
python .deepx/scripts/validate_framework.py
```

---

## [INTEGRATION] Build Order Dependency — dx_rt Must Be Installed First

- **Symptom**: `cmake` fails with `cannot find -ldx_engine` when building dx_app, or `gst-inspect-1.0 dxinfer` returns "No such element" when running dx_stream pipelines.
- **Root Cause**: Both dx_app and dx_stream depend on the dx_rt runtime library. If dx_rt is not installed (or is at an incompatible version), downstream builds and plugin registrations fail. The error messages do not always clearly indicate the missing dependency.
- **Fix**: Always install dx_rt first:

```bash
cd dx-runtime && ./install.sh       # Install dx_rt
cd dx_app && ./install.sh && ./build.sh   # Then dx_app
cd dx_stream && ./install.sh        # Then dx_stream
```

Verify with `dxrt-cli --version` before proceeding with sub-project builds.

---

## [INTEGRATION] No Cross-Project Python Imports Between dx_app and dx_stream

- **Symptom**: `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import one sub-project's Python module from the other. Code copied from a dx_app example fails when pasted into a dx_stream script.
- **Root Cause**: Neither sub-project is importable as a package — there is no `dx_app.*` / `dx_stream.*` package root (no `__init__.py` chain, not pip-installed). dx_app code only resolves its own imports via `from common.xxx` with `src/python_example/` on `sys.path`; that does not work from outside the app directory.
- **Fix**: Never import one sub-project's Python code from the other. Each sub-project is self-contained. Cross-project coupling is through **shared `.dxnn` models** kept name-consistent across `dx_app/config/model_registry.json` and `dx_stream/model_list.json`, and through the shared **dx_rt** runtime — not Python imports.

---

## [UNIVERSAL] Skipping sanity_check.sh Before Build — Silent Dependency Failures

- **Symptom**: `./install.sh` or `./build.sh` fails with cryptic errors: missing headers, broken symlinks, `cmake` can't find packages, or GStreamer plugin registration fails.
- **Root Cause**: dx-runtime components (dx_rt, driver, firmware) are not installed or are at an incompatible version. Building dx_app or dx_stream without a working dx_rt installation produces cascading failures that are difficult to diagnose because the error messages don't clearly indicate the missing base dependency.
- **Fix**: Always run the sanity check BEFORE building any sub-project:

```bash
# Step 0: Verify dx-runtime is installed
bash scripts/sanity_check.sh --dx_rt
# Exit 0 → proceed to build
# Exit 1 → install first:
bash install.sh --all --exclude-app --exclude-stream --skip-uninstall --venv-reuse
```

This should be the FIRST step in any build workflow. The dx-runtime-builder agent
performs this check automatically before routing to sub-project agents.

---

## [INTEGRATION] Skipping Cross-Validation with Precompiled Reference Model

- **Symptom**: Inference produces wrong results but validation passes because it only checks plausibility (non-zero detections, valid ranges) without comparing against a known-good baseline. The actual root cause (compilation issue vs app code issue) is misdiagnosed.
- **Root Cause**: Validation checks that output "looks reasonable" but never compares against reference output from a precompiled model or an existing verified example. Without a known-good baseline, the difference between a compilation regression and an app code bug is invisible.
- **Fix**: Use the **Differential Diagnosis** approach with precompiled reference models from `dx_app/assets/models/`:
  - **dx_app side** (Level 5.5): Run generated app with precompiled model, compare against existing verified example with `--verbose`/`--show-log`. See `dx_app/.deepx/skills/dx-agent-app-validate.md` Level 5.5.
  - **dx-compiler side** (Phase 5.7): Run verify.py with both precompiled and generated models. Both fail → verify.py bug. Reference passes, generated fails → compilation problem. See `dx-compiler/.deepx/agents/dx-dxnn-compiler.md` Phase 5.7.
  - Decision matrix covers 6 combinations (2 apps × 2 models) for comprehensive fault isolation.

## [UNIVERSAL] Overriding HARD GATE After User Says "Continue" — Unauthorized Bypass

- **Symptom**: Agent ran `sanity_check.sh --dx_rt` which failed (NPU device initialization failure).
  Agent ran `install.sh`, sanity check still failed. User said "use recommended defaults and work
  to completion". Agent reinterpreted this as permission to override the HARD GATE and continued
  building for 70+ minutes. Result: hybrid CPU/NPU workaround instead of proper NPU deployment.
- **Root Cause**: No explicit rule that user instructions cannot override the sanity check HARD GATE
  STOP. Agent rationalized "user wants me to continue" as overriding "STOP if still failing".
  Also marked the prerequisite check as "done" despite it never passing.
- **Fix**: The HARD GATE STOP is **unconditional**. Even explicit user instructions to continue
  do NOT override it. If NPU hardware initialization fails after install.sh:
  1. Inform user that a cold boot / system reboot is required
  2. STOP and wait for user to reboot and re-run `sanity_check.sh --dx_rt`
  3. NEVER proceed with code generation while sanity_check.sh is failing
  4. NEVER mark the prerequisite check as "done" when it actually failed
- **Prevention**: The HARD GATE rules now explicitly list "reinterpreting user's 'just continue' /
  'work to completion' / autopilot instructions as permission to override" as a PROHIBITED bypass.
